# Deckard's Deathcount
This is a Discord bot to track our Diablo 2 campaign deaths! It works off of a *gasp* hardcoded list of people who are playing with us, so it won't work exactly the same for you!

This is written using the NodeJS library [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) and the free tier of [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore). Thanks to the makers of these tools for making this possible!
